  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the idea, design and implementation of a triple store optimized to be used on mobile devices. The triple store implements an indexing structure similar to Hexastore utilizing the Tokyo Cabinet key-value store as persistent storage system. A simple and flexible API gives developers the chance to integrate TriplePlace in their applications to easily use semantic data on Android powered mobile devices. Finally TriplePlace is compared to Androjena in terms of main memory usage, extra storage needed in the final Android Package (APK) and speed.},

Fusing information and inferring links between the various applications and types of information provides relevant insights that make the available information on the Internet more valuable.

  Abstract                 = {Instant Messaging (IM) is in addition to Web and Email the most popular service on the Internet. With xOperator we present a strategy and implementation which deeply integrates Instant Messaging networks with the Semantic Web. The xOperator concept is based on the idea of creating an overlay network of collaborative information agents on top of social IM networks. It can be queried using a controlled and easily extensible language based on AIML templates. Such a deep integration of semantic technologies and Instant Messaging bears a number of advantages and benefits for users when compared to the separated use of Semantic Web technologies and IM, the most important ones being context awareness as well as provenance and trust. We showcase how the xOperator approach naturally facilitates contacts and calendar management as well as access to large scale heterogeneous information sources.},

  Abstract                 = {The phenomenon of online social networks reaches millions of users in the Internet nowadays. In these, users present themselves, their interests and their social links which they use to interact with other users. We present in this paper LifeSocial.KOM, a p2p-based platform for secure online social networks which provides the functionality of common online social networks in a totally distributed and secure manner. It is plugin-based, thus extendible in its functionality, providing secure communication and access-controlled storage as well as monitored quality of service, addressing the needs of both, users and system providers. The platform operates solely on the resources of the users, eliminating the concentration of crucial operational costs for one provider. In a testbed evaluation, we show the feasibility of the approach and point out the potential of the p2p paradigm in the field of online social networks.}

  Abstract                 = {Online social networking has become one of the most popular services on the Web. However, current social networks are like walled gardens in which users do not have full control over their data, are bound to specific usage terms of the social network operator and suffer from a lock-in effect due to the lack of interoperability and standards compliance between social networks. In this paper we propose an architecture for an open, distributed social network, which is built solely on Semantic Web standards and emerging best practices. Our architecture combines vocabularies and protocols such as WebID, FOAF, Semantic Pingback and PubSubHubbub into a coherent distributed semantic social network, which is capable to provide all crucial functionalities known from centralized social networks. We present our reference implementation, which utilizes the OntoWiki application framework and take this framework as the basis for an extensive evaluation. Our results show that a distributed social network is feasible, while it also avoids the limitations of centralized solutions.},
